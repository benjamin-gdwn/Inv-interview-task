"Create a function in either javascript, python or java that takes in a string as input and returns all the unique substrings of the string. 
The program should be case-insensitive, so for example "A" and "a" should be treated as the same letter.
If you use code from elsewhere as a basis for your solution please include a reference."

Break this down:

Create an input
Store the input value as a string
Submit button
When submitted perform a function that returns all unique sub strings in a list
    function 
    to be case insensitive we need to convert string all to lower case and trim spaces
    we need to check the whole string for the character at position 0
    we need to loop over each character in the string
    we need to have a pointer at starting position
    we need to have a pointer to current position in loop
    while the current position is less than the end of the length
        we need to check if that character that matches the start character
            if it doesnt then we need to move to the next character as the current position
                if it does we need to cut the string between starting position and current position and
                    return it then move onto the next starting position which would be after the initial 
                        start position.
Button to clear input and return to empty input

Thoughts now finished:

this was fun, to get into vanilla JS again after a little while was good. Found myself trying to loop over
every possible thing which turned into loop hell. Had to go through a few variations to eliminate strings with single 
letters aswell as well as i thought that was too simplistic.

I used w3schools.com for some refreshers on match method and to check what the best loop to use was.
